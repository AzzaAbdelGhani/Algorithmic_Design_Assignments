# DSSC - Algorithmic Design - Strassen's Algorithm

In this homework we are going to generalize the implementation of Strassen algorithm to deal with sqaure matrices of any dimension and non-square matrices (Rectangular matrices). Then, we are going to improve this algorithm by reducing the memory allocation and test the effects on the execution time.  

In order to generalize the Strassen algorithm, [**Dynamic Peeling**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Johnson8/publication/2779622_Implementation_of_Strassen's_Algorithm_for_Matrix_Multiplication/links/004635212d76a7ee76000000/Implementation-of-Strassens-Algorithm-for-Matrix-Multiplication.pdf) method has been used .You can find the generalization of strassen algorithm for any squared matrix in the file [generalized_strassen.c](AD_strassen_template/generalized_strassen.c) and you can find the generalization of strassen algorithm for any non-squared matrix in the file [rectangular_strassen.c](AD_strassen_template/rectangular_strassen.c). 

For developing this algorithm, we can notice that this algorithm consumes much memory in allocating the matrices S and P (we are allocating 17 matrices in each call). This memory consumption is reduced by using C matrix to store the results of 4 P matrices , and 3 matrices are left to be allocated. Furthermore, we are allocating 10 S matrices at the same time, instead we can allocate only one S matrix at once and deallocating it after it has been used. Notice that we need only 2 S matrices to be allocated simultanously , So in total we reduce the number of allocated matrices from 17 to 5. You can find the implementation of this improvement in the file [optimized_strassen.c](AD_strassen_template/optimized_strassen.c) 

Finally, by running `strassen_test` you will be able to see all the results to compare between all these implementations.
